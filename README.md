A small experiment with Isabelle/HOL I started in the 2017-18 holidays.

Proof that the Boolean Algebra the Huntington Algebra are the same thing,
following
    [A Complete Proof of the Robbins Conjecture, Mann, 2003](http://math.colgate.edu/~amann/MA/robbins_complete.pdf)

## Future ideas
* Prove the single lemma NAND algebra is a boolean algebra
    - `(((x ↑ y) ↑ z) ↑ (x ↑ ((x ↑ z) ↑ x))) = z`
* Translate the Robins Algebra proof into Isabelle/HOL
